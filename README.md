# Event-Driven Backtester

A beginner-friendly Python project for learning quantitative finance through software development.

The project is a historical daily-data event-driven backtester with a mean-reversion strategy, execution costs, risk metrics, chronological research splits, a shared-cash multi-asset engine, a CLI, and an optional local dashboard. It does not connect to a broker or process live/tick data.

## Project Layout

```text
src/quant_backtester/  Application package and dashboard
tests/                 Automated tests
data/                  Local market data (ignored by Git)
reports/               Generated charts and reports (ignored by Git)
```

## Setup

Create and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Run the test suite:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Install the optional dashboard dependency when you want the web interface:

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev,dashboard]'
```

Start the local dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run src/quant_backtester/dashboard.py
```

The dashboard accepts a local CSV, an uploaded CSV, or daily Yahoo Finance history. It displays strategy and buy-and-hold equity curves, drawdown, metrics, fills, and unfilled quantities.

Download historical daily data from Yahoo Finance:

```python
from quant_backtester.data import download_history

prices = download_history(
  ticker="SPY",
  start="2020-01-01",
  end="2024-01-01",
  output_path="data/SPY.csv",
)
print(prices.head())
```

The loader validates the required `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, and `Volume` columns, sorts timestamps, rejects missing or impossible prices, and optionally saves the cleaned data.

Calculate returns and create a buy-and-hold baseline:

```python
from quant_backtester.data import load_csv
from quant_backtester.returns import buy_and_hold

prices = load_csv("data/SPY.csv")
baseline = buy_and_hold(prices, initial_capital=10000)
print(baseline[["close", "equity"]].tail())
print("Final portfolio value:", baseline["equity"].iloc[-1])
```

The baseline assumes that the full investment is made at the first available closing price and held until the final date. It is deliberately simple: it does not model commissions, slippage, taxes, or timing decisions. Future strategies must beat this baseline after those costs, or they do not add value.

Run the first event-driven strategy backtest:

```python
from quant_backtester.backtest import run_backtest
from quant_backtester.strategy import MeanReversionStrategy

prices = load_csv("data/SPY.csv")
result = run_backtest(
  prices,
  symbol="SPY",
  strategy=MeanReversionStrategy(lookback=20, z_threshold=1.5),
  initial_cash=10000,
)

print(result.equity_curve.tail())
print(result.trades)
print(result.rejections)
print("Final portfolio value:", result.final_equity)
```

Signals use the current close and orders execute at the next bar's open. The result contains an equity curve, a fill ledger, an unfilled-quantity/rejection ledger, and the final portfolio state. Commission is charged per fill; slippage is adverse and specified in basis points.

Run a backtest from the command line and save reproducible outputs:

```bash
python -m quant_backtester.cli backtest data/SPY.csv \
  --symbol SPY \
  --initial-cash 10000 \
  --commission 1.00 \
  --slippage-bps 5 \
  --lookback 20 \
  --z-threshold 1.5 \
  --output-directory reports/SPY
```

The command writes `equity_curve.csv`, `trades.csv`, `rejections.csv`, and `metrics.json`. Download validated daily history from the CLI with:

```bash
python -m quant_backtester.cli download SPY \
  --start 2020-01-01 --end 2024-01-01 --output data/SPY.csv
```

For multi-symbol research, pass a mapping of symbol-to-OHLCV frames and symbol-to-strategy instances to `run_multi_asset_backtest` in `quant_backtester.multi_asset`. All symbols share the same cash balance; same-timestamp bars are processed in symbol order.

## Project Status

Implemented so far:

- Phase 0: project scaffolding, Python package setup, virtual environment, and testing flow
- Phase 1: OHLCV validation and ingestion
- Phase 2: simple returns, log returns, cumulative returns, and a buy-and-hold baseline
- Phase 3: event types and a queue-based event system for market, signal, order, and fill events
- Phase 4: portfolio accounting with cash, positions, and equity tracking
- Phase 5: a beginner mean-reversion strategy based on rolling z-scores
- Phase 5 integration: next-open event-driven backtest loop and equity curve
- Phase 6: configurable commission, adverse slippage, cash-aware fills, maximum share limits, and a partial-fill/rejection ledger
- Phase 7: annualized return and volatility, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown and duration, and closed-trade win rate/PnL/profit factor
- Phase 9 core: multi-asset event replay with shared cash and combined equity marking
- Phase 10 dashboard: local historical research interface with benchmark, risk, trade, and rejection views
- CLI workflows: validated Yahoo Finance download and CSV backtest report export
- Phase 8 foundation: chronological holdout and expanding walk-forward split utilities

What is still pending:

- Phase 8: run strategy evaluation across walk-forward folds, add parameter-sensitivity reports, and document out-of-sample experiments
- Phase 9: configuration-file-driven multi-asset CLI runs, portfolio exposure limits, correlation/concentration analysis, and structured logging
- Phase 10+: broker-specific live data and order APIs, tick data, market impact models, and advanced execution research

The dashboard uses historical bars only. Yahoo Finance is a convenience data source, not a broker feed, and the simulated fills are not suitable for live trading.

## Phase-Wise Learning and Implementation Plan

The project is intentionally developed in phases. Each phase introduces a small amount of finance and software design, produces a working result, and adds tests before the next layer is started. Do not add machine learning, live trading, or tick data until the simpler daily-data system is trustworthy.

### Phase 0: Tools and Python Foundations — DONE

**Goal:** Become comfortable running and changing the project.

Learn:

- Python functions, classes, modules, and exceptions
- Virtual environments and package installation
- Git basics: commits, branches, and readable project history
- `pandas` DataFrames, indexes, filtering, and rolling calculations
- `pytest` tests and the arrange-act-assert pattern

Build:

- Activate `.venv` and run the existing tests.
- Read the package code and change the CLI message.
- Create a small DataFrame manually and calculate its percentage changes.

Completion check:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m quant_backtester.cli --help
```

### Phase 1: Market Data and OHLCV — DONE

**Goal:** Understand what market data represents and make unreliable input safe to use.

Learn:

- Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume
- Trading days, timestamps, missing values, and duplicate rows
- Adjusted versus unadjusted prices
- Why data quality affects every backtest result

Build:

- Keep the `validate_ohlcv` function as the data contract.
- Add CSV loading and historical downloads.
- Add tests for missing columns, null values, duplicate timestamps, invalid prices, and negative volume.
- Download one symbol such as `SPY` and inspect the first and last rows.

Completion check:

- A valid CSV loads into a chronologically sorted DataFrame.
- Invalid input fails with a clear error.
- A sample file can be saved under `data/` and is ignored by Git.

### Phase 2: Returns and a Baseline — DONE

**Goal:** Learn how investment performance is measured before writing a trading strategy.

Learn:

- Simple return: $r_t = P_t / P_{t-1} - 1$
- Log return: $\log(P_t / P_{t-1})$
- Compounding and cumulative returns
- Buy-and-hold as a baseline

Build:

- Add a returns module that calculates daily and cumulative returns.
- Create a buy-and-hold result for the downloaded symbol.
- Plot the price and cumulative return.
- Test known input values by hand so the formulas are not accepted on intuition alone.

Completion check:

- The cumulative return agrees with the first and last prices.
- The baseline report states the start date, end date, initial capital, final value, and total return.

### Phase 3: Event-Driven Architecture — DONE

**Goal:** Understand how a trading system moves information through components.

Learn:

- Event-driven design and queues
- The difference between market data, signals, orders, and fills
- Why a strategy should not directly change cash or positions

Build these small domain objects:

- `MarketEvent`: a new OHLCV bar is available.
- `SignalEvent`: a strategy wants to increase, reduce, or close exposure.
- `OrderEvent`: the portfolio requests a quantity and direction.
- `FillEvent`: the simulated broker confirms an execution price and quantity.

Build a simple event loop:

1. Read one market bar.
2. Create a market event.
3. Let the strategy create a signal.
4. Convert the signal into an order.
5. Simulate a fill.
6. Update the portfolio.

Completion check:

- A test processes one bar in the expected event order.
- Components communicate through events rather than modifying one another's internal state.

### Phase 4: Portfolio, Orders, and Accounting — DONE

**Goal:** Make trades affect cash and positions correctly.

Learn:

- Long positions, quantities, notional value, and cash
- Market orders and execution price
- Mark-to-market portfolio value
- Basic accounting invariants

Build:

- A portfolio with initial cash, positions, cash balance, and total equity.
- Order creation from signals.
- A basic simulated broker that fills orders at the next bar's open.
- A trade ledger containing timestamp, symbol, side, quantity, price, and fees.

Test these invariants:

- Buying decreases cash.
- Selling increases cash.
- A position quantity changes by the fill quantity.
- Portfolio equity equals cash plus the market value of positions.
- A rejected order does not change the portfolio.

Completion check:

- A fixed sequence of bars and orders produces a hand-calculable final cash balance and position.

### Phase 5: First Strategy: Moving-Average Mean Reversion — DONE

**Goal:** Implement a simple, explainable strategy without accidentally using future information.

Learn:

- Simple moving averages
- Rolling windows and warm-up periods
- Mean reversion versus momentum
- Look-ahead bias and execution timing

Build:

- Calculate a rolling mean and rolling standard deviation.
- Generate a buy signal when price is sufficiently below its rolling mean.
- Generate an exit signal when price returns toward the mean.
- Start with one symbol and one position at a time.
- Generate the signal using the current bar but execute on the next bar.

Completion check:

- Signals are absent during the warm-up period.
- A test proves that changing a future price does not change an earlier signal.
- The strategy can be run through the event loop without directly changing the portfolio.

### Phase 6: Realistic Backtesting — DONE (core)

**Goal:** Make the simulated results less optimistic.

Learn:

- Commission and spread costs
- Slippage and market impact
- Position sizing and exposure limits
- Why frequent trading can destroy a strategy's edge

Build:

- Commission per fill and adverse fixed-basis-point slippage.
- Maximum share size and available-cash checks at the next open.
- Partial-fill and rejected-quantity records with reasons.
- Fill ledger and an execution configuration object.
- Volume-based market impact and portfolio-level exposure sizing remain future work.

Completion check:

- The same strategy produces a lower or equal final value after costs.
- Tests verify fee calculations, slippage direction, and position limits.

### Phase 7: Performance and Risk Metrics — DONE (core)

**Goal:** Evaluate a strategy beyond whether the final balance increased.

Learn:

- Annualized return and volatility
- Sharpe ratio and its assumptions
- Maximum drawdown and recovery time
- Win rate, average win, average loss, and profit factor
- The difference between return and risk-adjusted return

Build:

- A performance report from the equity curve and closed-trade ledger.
- Annualized return/volatility, Sharpe, maximum drawdown/duration, win rate, average trade PnL, and profit factor.
- Dashboard equity and drawdown charts with a buy-and-hold equity comparison.
- Tests using small, known equity curves with expected metrics.

Completion check:

- Every report includes the data period, symbol, strategy settings, costs, and metrics.
- Results can be reproduced from the same input data and configuration.

### Phase 8: Research Discipline and Validation — IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Learn why a backtest can look impressive and still be wrong.

Learn:

- In-sample versus out-of-sample data
- Train, validation, and test periods
- Walk-forward evaluation
- Parameter overfitting and selection bias
- Survivorship bias and delisted securities

Build:

- Chronological holdout splitting and expanding walk-forward fold generation without shuffling.
- Running and aggregating backtests across folds is still pending.
- Parameter-sensitivity tables and an experiment-results ledger are still pending.

Completion check:

- The final strategy is evaluated on data that was not used to choose its parameters.
- The README clearly reports both successful and unsuccessful experiments.

### Phase 9: Multiple Assets and Better Engineering — IN PROGRESS

**Goal:** Extend the system while preserving correctness.

Learn:

- Portfolio diversification and asset allocation
- Correlation and concentration
- Configuration-driven applications
- Logging, type hints, and integration tests

Build:

- Multiple symbols with separate positions and shared cash in the Python API.
- Per-symbol maximum share limits and a combined equity curve.
- CLI download and single-symbol backtest/report commands.
- Portfolio-level exposure limits, config-file-driven multi-asset CLI runs, and structured logging are still pending.

Completion check:

- One command creates a complete report from a configuration file.
- Existing single-asset behavior remains unchanged.

### Phase 10: Optional Advanced Extensions — DASHBOARD STARTED

Only begin these after Phases 0-9 are working and understood.

- Tick data and broker-specific asynchronous APIs
- Limit order books and market microstructure
- Options pricing and volatility surfaces
- Risk metrics such as historical VaR and expected shortfall
- A local Streamlit dashboard for historical data
- Machine-learning signals with strict time-series validation
- A separate C++ execution or limit-order-book project

These are separate learning tracks, not prerequisites for a credible first backtesting project. A reliable, explainable daily-data system is more valuable than a complicated system whose results cannot be trusted.

## Suggested Weekly Rhythm

For each phase:

1. Learn the finance concept in plain language.
2. Write down a small example with numbers.
3. Implement the smallest useful function.
4. Add tests before adding features.
5. Run one experiment and inspect the output.
6. Record assumptions, results, and questions in the README or a research note.

Do not move to the next phase merely because the code runs. Move when you can explain the calculation, identify its assumptions, and describe at least one way it could be wrong.
